## Overview

This application automates the process of searching for auto parts on Tosshin's website and extracts basic information about each part. The scraper exports all the collected data into a formatted Excel spreadsheet for easy reference.

## Features

- **Keyword-Based Searching**: Search for auto parts using specific part numbers or keywords from a text file
- **Simple Data Extraction**: Captures basic part information including:
  - Manufacturer name (maker)
  - Weight
  - Price
  - URL to the search results
- **Organized Output**: Exports data to a well-formatted Excel spreadsheet
- **Screenshot Capture**: Takes screenshots of search results for reference
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive exception handling and logging

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Windows OS
- Python 3.x (if running from source)
- Python UV (for virtual environment management)
- Chrome browser

### Running the Application

#### From Source Code

1. Create a virtual environment using UV:

   ```bash
   uv venv .venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .venv\\Scripts\\activate
     ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Setup Instructions

1. When first run, the application will create a `Keywords.txt` file
2. Add your part numbers or keywords to this file, one per line
   - Lines starting with `#` will be ignored (can be used for comments)
   - Example format:

     ```text
     # Enter your keywords below
     90916-03100
     15643-31050
     ```

3. Run the application again to start the scraping process
4. Results will be saved to an Excel file in the output directory

## Output

The scraper generates the following outputs:

1. **Excel Spreadsheet**: Contains all scraped data (part number, maker, weight, price, and URL)

2. **Screenshots**: Captures of search result pages are saved in the "Tosshin Screenshots" folder

3. **Log Files**: Detailed logs are stored in the "logs" folder for troubleshooting
